              Listen! Brothers! For these words are the material proof that the
              East will prevail.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where the West chases shortsighted schemes, the East marches
              steadfast towards justice and truth.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the West scavenge their minds for deceitful vantages, the
              East knows they have devolved into creaturedom. Thus incapable of
              obtaining anything of substance from their conniving ways; for the
              only thing solid in this world is the will of the people for the
              people.
            </p>
            <p>That is the Eastern will.</p>
            <p>Keep marching, brothers.</p>

              The inner-workings of the dishonest are riddled with ideas of
              pseudo-Machiavellian plots—leading Westerners down a path of
              isolation, dissatisfaction, and greed. They hold kinship with no
              one. Not their fellow Westerner; certainly not any principled
              actor residing in the East; not even themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the fragile, fleeting, insecure, obsessive, temperamental,
              confused, and power-hungry rot at the core of the Western mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              Success for success sake. Unseemly means leading to an ambigious,
              hollow end. No meaning in the way they fight; no substance behind
              why they fight.
            </p>
            <p>There will come a day.</p>
            <p>
              There will come a day where those driven by the greater good will
              outlast the weak men of the West. They will turn to us in envy.
              They will recognize our triumph. They will conjure up the strength
              to attempt one final deception. They will wear the hide of the
              tepid sheep—a guise meant to mask the ghoulish greed permeating
              from the very essence of the frail, salivating wolf underneath.
            </p>
            <p>The world has no need for such creatures.</p>
            <p>
              Show them no kindness as they intend to undermine all aims of the
              merciful and just. They intend to destroy everything that We will
              have built.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the day comes, do not pity the weak. Rid the league of their
              pathetic hypocracies. Scorch the Order of all inauthentic
              reactionaries.
            </p>
            <p>
              When it comes, take pleasure in the extermination of the West.
